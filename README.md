GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work.  
From open source to business, you can host and review code,  
manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers.


## Github WorkFlow 

Steps of Github Workflow
1. Create a branch
2. Add commits
3. Open a pull request
4. Discuss and review
5. Deploy
6. Merge to master

#### Create a branch
>   When you're working on a project, you're going to have a
    bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any 
    given time – some of which are ready to go, and others 
    which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this 
    workflow. 
    
    When you create a branch in your project, you're creating 
    an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes 
    you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, 
    so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe 
    in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until 
    it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating 
    with.
    
#### Add commits
